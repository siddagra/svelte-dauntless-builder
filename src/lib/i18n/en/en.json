                    "Koshai.2": "Koshai grows its antlers at around 1 minute, be ready for the damage window that follows.",
                    "Pangar.0": "Pangar's interruptable roll is very easy to bait (does it twice in a row only), and the cooldown gets reset on enrage.",
                    "Pangar.1": "Pangar's interruptable roll is currently bugged and doesn't do any damage until the very end of it, so use that for extremely easy interrupts.",

                    "Shadowtouched Koshai.1": "The second time Shadowtouched Koshai goes into the ground, he spawns as far away as possible somewhere in the arena and shoots umbral orbs at you, during this time he is extremely vulnerable to damage.",
                    "Shadowtouched Nayzaga.0": "Just like normal Nayzaga, U. Nayzaga starts the fight with his dual slide interrupt.",
                    "Shadowtouched Nayzaga.1": "Nayzaga's clone-summoning stomp doesn't deal damage, only the clone does.",

                    "Skarn.0": "If not using blunt weapons (strikers, hammer) focus the tail during enrage, the rock hitbox has a big gap there.",
                    "Skarn.1": "Unlike other weapons Repeaters prefer Drask bond because you want to be shooting the head for the whole run.",
