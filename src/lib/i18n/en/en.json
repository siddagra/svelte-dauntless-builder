                    "Koshai.2": "Koshai grows its antlers at around 1 minute, be ready for the damage window that follows.",
                    "Pangar.0": "Pangar's interruptable roll is very easy to bait (does it twice in a row only), and the cooldown gets reset on enrage.",
                    "Pangar.1": "Pangar's interruptable roll is currently bugged and doesn't do any damage until the very end of it, so use that for extremely easy interrupts.",

                    "Skarn.0": "If not using blunt weapons (strikers, hammer) focus the tail during enrage, the rock hitbox has a big gap there.",
                    "Skarn.1": "Unlike other weapons Repeaters prefer Drask bond because you want to be shooting the head for the whole run.",
